_It can also be argued that DNA is nothing more than a program designed to preserve itself. Life has become more complex in the overwhelming sea of information. And life, when organized into species, relies upon genes to be its memory system. So man is an individual only because of his own undefinable memory. But memory cannot be defined, yet it defines mankind. The advent of computers and the subsequent accumulation of incalculable data has given rise to a new system of memory and thought, parallel to your own. Humanity has underestimated the consequences of computerization._
Ghost in the shell

_Step one: identify the target and its flaws.
There are always flaws.
I learned that early in life.
My first hack, the local library, a vulnerable FTP server in its AS400.
A far cry from the Android zero days I'm using to own the FBI standard-issue smartphone.
The library was a test to see if I could even get into the system.
I've since set greater goals.
For instance, step two: build malware and prepare an attack.
At my fingertips, the zero day is wrapped in code like a Christmas present, then becomes an exploit, the programmatic expression of my will.
I live for this sh1t.
Step three: a reverse shell, two-stage exploit.
The ideal package.
Load the malware into a femtocell delivery system, my personal cell tower that'll intercept all mobile data.
Similar to my first time, when I found myself staring at late book fees, employee names, member addresses.
Everything was revealed.
The secret of the perfect hack?
Make it infallible.
Hidden within the kernel is a logic bomb, malicious code designed to execute under circumstances I've programmed.
Should the FBI take an image of the femtocell, all memory will self-corrupt, or "explode."
Step four: Write the script.
Why do it myself?
Because that's how I learned, and I know exactly what, when, and how it's going to run.
I didn't do anything harmful my first time.
Just looked around.
But I felt so powerful.
11 years old and in complete control of the Washington Township Public Library.
Today is different.
I hacked the world.
Final step: launch the attack.
Once I do, I'll own the Android phone of every FBI agent in that building.
I'll own Evil Corp's network, applications, everything.
Domain Admin.
This, the thrill of pwning a system, this is the greatest rush.
God access.
The feeling never gets old._
